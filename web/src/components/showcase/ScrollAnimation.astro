              <h2>Understanding Key Concepts</h2>
              <p>
                Before diving into the world of CSS animations, it's essential
                to understand some key concepts:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Transitions:</strong> CSS transitions allow for smooth
                  changes between different states of an element. They are perfect
                  for adding subtle effects like fading or sliding.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Keyframes:</strong> Keyframes define the stages of an animation's
                  movement and appearance. By specifying keyframes, you can create
                  complex animations with precise control over timing and positioning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Animation Properties:</strong> CSS provides a range of
                  properties to control animations, including duration, timing function,
                  delay, and iteration count. Understanding how to manipulate these
                  properties is crucial for creating compelling animations.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
              <p>
                The versatility of CSS animations knows no bounds. Here are just
                a few examples of how they can be used:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Hover Effects:</strong> Add flair to your buttons and links
                  with hover effects that respond to user interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Page Transitions:</strong> Smoothly transition between
                  pages to create a seamless browsing experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Animated Illustrations:</strong> Bring illustrations and
                  graphics to life with animated sequences that engage users and
                  convey information in a dynamic way.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Ready to take your animations to the next level? Consider
                exploring these advanced techniques:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>JavaScript Integration:</strong> Combine CSS animations
                  with JavaScript to create interactive experiences that respond
                  to user input.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Optimize your animations
                  for performance by minimizing layout recalculations and leveraging
                  hardware acceleration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensure your animations adapt
                  seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices for a consistent
                  user experience.
                </li>
              </ul>
